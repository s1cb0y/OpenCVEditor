# OpenCVEditor

This app serves as a playground for various OpenCV functions. The UI is created with ImGui. It runs on Windows, Mac and Linux. It can be built with the help of platform dependent premake scripts.
The only requirement is an already installed OpenCV environment. 
Please add the OpenCV library paths to the path variable. If necessary the dynamic libraries have to be copied to the executables.
