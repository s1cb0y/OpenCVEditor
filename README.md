# OpenCVEditor

This app serves as a playground for various OpenCV functions. The UI is created with ImGui. The app engine was insired by TheChernos [Hazel Engine](https://github.com/TheCherno/Hazel). Many thanks for your great YT Tutorials! OpenCVEditor runs on Windows, Mac and Linux. It can be built with the help of platform dependent premake scripts.
The only requirement is an already installed OpenCV environment. 
Please add the OpenCV library paths to the path variable. If necessary the dynamic libraries have to be copied to the executables.
It can be, that your library paths differ from those defined in the premake5.lua file. Please modify the path if nedded.
